Prompt - 

The monthly payment for a given loan pays the principal and the interest.
The monthly interest is computed by multiplying the monthly interest rate and the balance (the remaining principle). 
The principal paid for the month is therefore the monthly payment minus the monthly interest.

Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount, number of years, the interest rate, 
and displays the amortization schedule for the loan.

write a loop to display the table. since the monthly payment is the same for each month, 
it should be computed before the loop. the balance is initially the loan amount. 
For each iteration in the loop, computer the interest and principal and update the balance.

annualInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 100;
i = monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 12;
n = numberOfYear * 12;
monthlyPayment = (loanAmount * i * Math.pow(i + 1, n)) / (Math.pow(i + 1, n) - 1);
totalPayment = monthlyPayment * 12;

The loop may look like this:
