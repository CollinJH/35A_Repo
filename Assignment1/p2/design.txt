Math approximate the square root

There are severial techniques for implementing
the sqrt method in the math class.
one such technique is known as the babylonian method
it approximates the square root of a number, n
by repeatedly performaing a caluclation Using

nextGuess = (lastGuess + n/ lastGuess) / 2

when nextGuess and lastGuess are almost identical 
nextGuess is the approximated square root.
The initial guess can be any positive value (1)
this value will be starting value for lastGuess
If the difference between nextGuess and lastGuess is less than a very small number
such as 0.0001 you can claim that nextGuess is the approximated square root of of n
if not nextGuess becomes lastGuess and the approximation process continues

implement the following method that returns the square root of negative

public static double sqrt(long n)
