## Assignment 6

# Techniques used

utilizies creating a proper project structure using packages to efficiently use code from other classes

implements user created exceptions that log into a file for easy tracking

Writing student_grade serialized output to its own text file using methods from several different objects to do so
demonstrating how object oriented programming makes our lives easier

Creating an adapter or API using java's interface and its abstract class implementation

# Project overview

This project effectively takes student quiz data and uses 4 different driver classes to showcase
some of the functionality that has been developed in this project, including exceptions, fileIO, and utilizing multiple classes across packages
to calculate lowest, highest, and average grades for an individual student or for all of them as a whole

# How to use

1. Depending on the driver you compile and run will have a different output
2. Driver1 will demonstrate the StudentGradingException
3. Driver2 will demonstrate serializing the students grades into a file
4. Driver3 will demonstrate the usage of the StudentAPI
5. ReadSource is the original driver from Assignemnt5, this will calculate the high score, low score, and average scores of every student object
