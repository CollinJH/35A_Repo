Prompt - 

The formula for converting centigrade temperature to Fahrenheit is: 
 
F = 32 + C (180.0/100.0) 
 
Write a program that asks the user to enter a temperature reading in Centigrade and then prints the equivalent Fahrenheit value. 
It then asks the user to enter a Fahrenheit value and prints out the equivalent Centigrade value. 
Run the program several times. Be sure to include at least one negative temperature reading in your test cases. 

Design

takes in centigrade temperature input from user and outputs the fahrenheit value
takes in fahrenheit temperature input from user and outputs centigrade value

Variables

    (double) variable to keep track of user input
    (double) variables to keep track of fahrenheit and centigrade result values

Input

    using scanner
    sysout("Enter a centigrade value to convert to fahrenheit")
    userInput = scanner.nextInt() to store first value

    second prompt will happen after 1st calculation

    sysout("Enter a fahrenheit value to convert to centigrade")
    userInput = scanner.nextInt() to store second value

Processing

    apply userinput to formula
    F = 32 + C * (180.0/100.0)
    or
    C = F * (100.0/180.0) - 32


Printing

    sysout conveted values
