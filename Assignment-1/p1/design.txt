Variables
    (int) variables to keep track of product quantity, quantityTV, quantityVCR, quantityRmtCnt, quantityCD, quantityTapeRec
    (float) variables for each unit price - priceTV, priceVCR, priceRmtCnt, priceCD, priceTapeRec
    (float) variables for total price - totalTV, totalVCR, totalRmtCnt, totalCD, totalTapeRec
    (float) variables for total, tax and grandtotal - total, tax, grandtotal

Input
    Prompt user 
    System.out.printf("enter # of [item] bought");
    Use scanner to take input from user for each qty of TV, VCR, RmtCnt, CD, and TapeRec

Processing
    Calculate total price for each input
    total[item] = quantity[item] * price[item]
    .
