Write a program to perform statistical analysis of scores for a class of students.
The class may have up to 40 students.There are five quizzes during the term. 
Each student is identified by a four-digit student ID number.

The program is to print the student scores and calculate and print the statistics for each quiz.
The output is in the same order as the input; 
no sorting is needed. 
The input is to be read from a text file. 
The output from the program should be similar to the following:

class student

    instance variables to hold
    student ID
    array of quiz scores

    constructor
    assign instance variables to arguments

    getters and setters

    print value method

class Utility

    instance variable to hold
    file name

    constructor
    assign instance variable to file name passed

    method readFile()
    this method will take in an empty student object array

    using buffered reader to read next line
    while (buffer != eof)
        skip first line of header
        use tokenizer to break down a whole line into tokens
        each token will be separated from a space as shown by the delimiter
        allows us to loop through the 6 token individually 
        instead of one long line

        With lines split up into tokens now
        get first token, assign as Student ID
        get next 5 tokens assign as quiz scores
        using Integer.parseInt to use the tokens are integers
        this is done so type is casted properly

    will return a populated student object array


class Statistics

    three private instance variables arrays
    lowvalues
    highvalues
    averagevalues

    constructor
    creates 3 new arrays

    findLow method
        pass in student array object
        pass in quiz score index

        for loop to loop through student array
        if score < lowest score
        lowest score = score

    findHigh method
        pass in student array object
        pass in quiz score index

        for loop to loop through student array
        if score > highest score
        highest score = score

    findAvg method
        pass in student array object
        pass in quiz score index

        for loop to loop through student array
        add up entire sum of quiz scores

        return sum / student.length

    print method

class ReadSource

    create a new array of empty student objects
    create new utility object passing in file
    create statistic object

    pass empty student array into utility
    this will populate the new student array
    calculate statistics
    print statistics
